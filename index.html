						Well I'm certainly grateful for this magnificent washout, eh, turnout, and, eh, now I'd like to say a few words. Hello, I must be going. I cannot stay, I came to say I must be going. I'm glad I came, but just the same I must be going.
					</p>
					<p> 
						I'll stay a week or two. I'll stay the summer through. But I am telling you that I must be going.
					</p>
					<p>
						I'll do anything you say. In fact, I'll even stay! But I must be going.
					</p>
					<p>
						This fact I'll emphasize with stress, I never take a drink unless, somebody's buying.
					</p>
					<p>
						I hate a dirty joke, I do, unless it's told by someone who, knows how to tell it.
